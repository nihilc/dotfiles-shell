# Nihilc's dotfiles shell

There are my dotfiles for shell programs. You can find my nvim config [here](https://github.com/nihilc/nvim-config)

## List of programs

- tmux >= 3.3a
- zsh
- git
- htop

## Tmux

Prefix: `<C-z>`

It's just a simple config to work fine with nvim and other tools, the most important changes are in the bindings. I use my own [theme](https://github.com/nihilc/tmux-theme)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check all the bindings and unbindings [here](./tmux/README.md)
